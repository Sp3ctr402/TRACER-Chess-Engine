# TRACER - C# Chess_Engine
This is a C# Chess Bot programmed inside the framework of the Chess Coding Challenge from Sebastian Lague.

So after participating I wanted to challenge myself to make the best possible bot I can without Token Limiations.
This repo will summarize the process.

# Lichess
I implemented UCI support to the framework, so anybody can play against the bot !

When I'm done with this project, I will run the bot on Lichess for a few days to get an estimate ranking.
